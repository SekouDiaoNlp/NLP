(b) Should WKH lose publication rights to any Title, then WKH may so terminate this Agreement in regard to that Title effective upon such loss of publication rights; (c) Should WKH cancel the publication of any Title the continued publication of which is within WKH’s sole control without promptly establishing a successor publication to that canceled Title, whether such publication is titled the same or not, then WKH may so terminate this Agreement in regard to that Title after services are performed for the final Issue of that canceled Title; (d) Should WKH sell, assign, or otherwise transfer its right of ownership or its right to print any Title or successor thereto to a third party, and such purchaser, assignee or transferor does not wish to continue Printer’s role under this Agreement, or the Printer does not consent to WKHs assignment of this Agreement in regard to that Title upon consent being sought, then WKH may so terminate this Agreement in regard to that Title upon consummation of such sale, assignment or other transfer hereunder.; (e) Should specifications of any Title materially change and/or Printer is not capable of performing hereunder in regard to such changed specifications, or such changes result in Printer’s pricing as set forth herein no longer being deemed competitive by WKH, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, with that of similarly qualified Printers, then after printer is offered right of first negotiation for said Title WKH may so terminate this Agreement in regard to that Title on not less than ninety (90) days prior written notice to Printer; (f) Should any Title not be produced at an acceptable level of quality for three or more Issues within any 12 month period, WKH may so terminate this Agreement in regard to that Title on forty- five (45) days notice, provided that WKH notifies Printer in writing of each such quality default by Printer within fifteen days after delivery of the applicable Issue of the Title.

Forecast. On or about September 1st of each year, WKH will give Printer it’s reasonably estimated printing forecast for the following calendar year for each assigned Title, in regard to the number of Issues, average copies per Issue, average number of pages per copy and projected mailing dates of the Issues. Such forecast shall not be binding upon WKH, but WKH will promptly update the forecast as necessary to provide Printer with advance notice of any expected material changes made known to WKH. 6. Orders. Printer shall receive a print order or specification sheet (hereafter referred to as “Order”) and electronic print files from a WKH business unit as a precondition to initiating production on any Issue. The final electronic files necessary to initiation of such production will be noted as such when the same are delivered to the Printer so that Printer shall reasonably understand that WKH considers the Turnaround Time (as defined below) to have begun if measured pursuant to Paragraph 7 (b) below by reference to the receipt of such files. All Orders will be communicated either in writing or electronically by facsimile or email. WKH may cancel any Order, or part thereof at any time. WKH shall be responsible for payment to Printer for: i) any work performed prior to cancellation ii) the actual unrecoverable third party out of pocket and iii) unrecoverable internal costs incurred by Printer as a direct result of such full or partial Order cancellation. WKH shall be responsible for payment of such cancellation costs promptly upon receipt of reasonable proof of Printer having incurred such costs. Notwithstanding the above, WKH shall be able to postpone the manufacturing process for a commercially reasonable time in regard to any Order or part thereof prior to such postponed Order or part thereof going “on press” without incurring any such liability for costs arising from such delay, although the Turnaround Time shall be extended on a day for day basis for the length of the postponement. 7. Manufacturing Commitments Printer agrees to meet the following commitments in manufacturing all Titles (collectively, “Products”) for WKH as well as those set forth in Paragraph 13: (a) Location. Printer will manufacture and distribute Titles awarded under this contract in Printer’s facilities at Mechanicsburg, PA (“Printer Facilities”). Printer may manufacture and perform other services set forth herein at other facilities owned by Printer if WKH provides its prior written consent in regard to any specific or class of Product, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that such consent in no way shall be interpreted as relieving Printer of the obligation to meet time deadlines or price obligations set forth in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any increase in postage and freight costs that would otherwise be borne by WKH for any such affected Order. Inno event may Printer manufacture all or any material part of any Product or perform other services set forth herein at the facilities of other suppliers via subcontracting or other arrangement without the express prior written consent of WKH, such consent not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and subject to the same proviso as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.

Component Committed Turnaround Time Cover or Text 2Color or 4Color The Committed Total Turnaround Time for the Issue will be determined by the maximum of the Committed Turnaround Times for the components. For example, an Issue with a 1 color cover and 1 color text shall have a Committed Turnaround Time of 8 days. An issue with a 4 color cover and 1 color text will have a Committed Turnaround Time of 10 days. Ink Colors Actual Total Turnaround Time will be measured from the later of Printer’s last receipt of an Order and/or the final electronic print files received by the printer thereby enabling the printer to begin work in regard to any Issue to the following: (i) in regard to an Issue that is to be mailed to end users, to the date Printer delivers substantially all copies of an Issue that meet the test of Acceptance as defined in Paragraph 13 to the first of (a’) the U.S. postal facility selected by Printer to most economically mail the Issue or (b’) a sorting facility owned or controlled by Printer, or contracted with by Printer, to provide sorting services in regard to such Issue, or (ii) if the Issue is to be primarily the subject of a bulk shipment to warehouses WKH specifies for the storage of back copies (or for another form of ultimate distribution other than being mailed directly to end users) to the date such bulk shipment of substantially all copies of that Issue that meet the test of Acceptance as defined in Paragraph 13 leaves Printer’s dock, or (iii) if the Issue is to be primarily stored by Printer at WKH’s direction, to the date Printer believes in good faith that substantially all copies of that Issue meet the test of Acceptance as Defined in Paragraph 13 and such are placed into storage by Printer. Committed Total Turnaround Times may be extended for the following reasons: (i) WKH affiliates for which an Issue is being prepared, at their discretion, may permit longer Turnaround Times than those stated above if explicitly provided on the face of an Order. (ii) Committed Turnaround Times may be extended on a day for day basis if WKH’s approval of proofs is delayed due to WKH’s fault based on the time frames set forth in Paragraph 11. (iii) Committed Turnaround Times may be extended on a day for day basis for delays in receipt of advertising files, mail files, or materials provided by WKH such as inserts or reply cards. WKH may, at the time an Order is submitted, request expedited processing for particular Orders, in which case manufacturing and distribution time shorter than the calculated Committed Total Turnaround Time shall be determined by Printer on a case-by-case basis with mutually agreed pricing adjustments if necessary. (c) Acceptable Quantities. In order to qualify for Acceptance as hereinafter provided in Paragraph 13, Printer must mail or otherwise deliver each Order as set forth above in sub-paragraph (b) in quantities that fall within the tolerances specified in the table below, unless WKH authorizes different tolerances on the face of an Order or otherwise authorizes a different tolerance in writing in advance of the end of the period of the Committed Total Turn Around Time for any Issue in an Order. Except as otherwise set forth explicitly to the contrary in this Paragraph, allowable quantities are calculated as the percentage specified below multiplied by the final quantity indicated on each respective Order. Printer must deliver the minimum quantity specified on the Order and not exceed allowable overruns. Printer may bill WKH only for actual quantities delivered within this tolerance. a Undesatue -——- Seen Se (d) Other. All WKH printing done under this Agreement will be done right-grain unless approved in writing by WKH in advance of any Product going “on press”. 8. Postage, Freight and Delivery. Pricing includes preparation by Printer of completed Products (including without limitation the polybagging of Issues or insertion of blow-ins or other inserts of any nature) for mailing but does not include the costs of postage or freight. WKH may specify commercial carrier(s) to be used and WKH may be billed directly for freight in such event. If commercial carriers are used, WKH shall make all claims for goods damaged in transit directly and solely against such freight carriers. To the extent Printer delivers any Product, risk of loss remains with Printer until time of delivery to WKH or its designated recipient. 9, Additional Charges. Pricing does not include sales, use or other excise taxes, all of which may be added to WKH’s invoice and is to be paid by WKH. If WKH does not take delivery of finished Products for more than 120days after completion of the manufacturing process, Printer may assess storage charges per skid per month at rates exhibited in the Price List. No charges in addition to those specified in this Agreement shall be assessed to WKH for the performance of any services specified herein. 10. Payment Terms. Printer may invoice upon mailing date or shipment of finished Product or delivery of the same into storage at Printer’s location, if so requested by WKH. Payment terms will be Net 30. Printer will create separate invoice accounts for all WKH units as requested by WKH. Invoices will reference WKH’s Purchase Order number, the applicable WKH business unit and other information reasonably requested by WKH. Printer will provide a summary of charges on the invoice with cost elements assigned to WK general ledger account codes. Each WKH unit will provide Printer its general ledger account codes and definitions. If a WKH unit does not provide appropriate information regarding its general ledger account codes, Printer is not required to provide the summary described immediately above 11. Customer Approvals and Materials. WKH shall specify on the face of the Order the proofs and interim manufacturing reviews necessary for each Product so that WKH may review proofs, samples and other interim work. Printer will not proceed with production until WKH approvals are received. Printer shall specify in writing to WKH upon delivery of any such proof, sample or interim work a commercially reasonable time for WKH to review the same before approval of any such item is presumed. Printer shall have no liability for errors approved by WKH. 12. Paper Use Commitments. Printer agrees to the following with regard to paper used in the production of Products: (a) Source. At its option, WKH may (i) furnish paper for printing of any or all Issues (“Customer- Furnished paper”), (ii) specify paper type, weight, mill of manufacture and supplier of paper to be used by Printer (“Publisher-Directed paper”), or (iii) purchase paper from Printer (“Printer-Supplied paper”). All Customer-Furnished, Publisher-Directed or Printer-Supplied paper shall be “first quality” and be guaranteed by the mill of manufacture to be free of defects. (b) Receipt of Customer-Furnished Paper. In the case of Customer-Furnished paper, Printer will receive WKH’s paper at Printer Facilities and will perform an external examination of rolls for visible damage or errors. Printer shall not be responsible for verification of quantity or quality thereof. If Printer shall discover any error or damage to rolls, whether on receipt or at the time of printing or binding, Printer shall notify WKH promptly of the error or damage, together with any recommendations with respect to time and cost of repair, replacement or correction, and act in accordance with WKH’s instructions. Printer shall cooperate with WKH in filing any claims for defective or damaged paper and in the preparation and filing of other notices or documents as WKH may request to protect WKH’s interest in such paper. (c) Paper Handling Fees. Printer will charge no handling fees for Customer-Furnished paper. In the case of Publisher-Directed paper, Printer will charge no more than 3% in handling fees above the cost of such Publisher-Directed paper consumed for an Issue, using the most recently invoiced per-pound price for such paper by WKH’s paper supplier. In the case of Printer-Supplied paper, Printer will charge no more than 3% over its cost of paper consumed for an Issue. Printer-Supplied paper cost shall be defined as the most-recently invoiced per-pound price by Printer’s paper supplier, with respect to the acquisition of all paper that includes paper provided to WKH. (d) Minimum Inventory and Storage. Printer shall store without charge paper stock in the amount required for each Issue on press plus enough paper to print the number of additional Issues, or fraction thereof, as defined by the production frequency in the below table for each assigned Title (Minimum Paper Inventory). Number of Issues of paper required, in addition to paper required for on-press Issue Production Frequency Printer shall keep Customer-Furnished or Publisher-Directed paper segregated and labeled as belonging to WKH. Storage charges will apply to any inventory exceeding the Minimum Paper Inventory with charges applied according to the per skid storage charges defined in Paragraph 9. (e) Paper Requirements. Pricing Scales will be used to determine the paper requirements for each Order (“Contractual Paper Requirements”), unless WKH approves in writing a deviation from the Contractual Paper Requirements. (f) Usage Reporting. Printer will Issue a usage report within five (5) days of the completion of the production for each Issue showing actual consumption vs. Contractual Paper Requirements for each type of paper used on that Issue. Printer will reconcile over- and under-consumption for each WKH unit every quarter to determine net over- or under-consumption for that unit. In the case of Customer Furnished paper, Printer shall Issue a report on a monthly basis within five (5) days after the last day of the month listing all receipts of Customer Furnished paper including inventory in the printer’s storage facility at that point in time. Usage and inventory reports required under this Paragraph will be provided to WKH’s designated paper supply chain partner. (g) Over-Consumption. Printer shall not be able to seek any payment from WKH for consumption of any Printer-Supplied or Publisher-Directed paper and shall provide a prompt credit to the appropriate WKH unit for WKH’s cost of Customer-Furnished Paper in excess of Contractual Paper Requirements used in regard to the production of any Order. The value of under-consumption, if any, of any type of paper shall be used as a credit against the value of any over-consumption, if any. To the extent there exists unused credits for over-consumption of Customer-Furnished Paper when this Agreement expires or earlier terminates, all such credits shall be immediately paid by Printer to WKH in a lump sum by check. (h) Continuous Improvement, Under-Consumption and Gain Sharing. Printer agrees for the Term of this Agreement to work with WKH to reduce overall paper usage for production of WKH’s Products. Printer agrees to meet with WKH quarterly to evaluate the success of procedures implemented and to review new strategies for going forward. In the case of net under-consumption of paper in any given quarter, which is not absorbed by the credits required above for the value of any over-consumption WKH shall pay the printer fifty (50) percent of the value for the paper under-consumed at WKH’s then-current invoice price. Within 30 days of each anniversary of the contract, in the event there is net annual underconsumption of 2% or more and the printer is paid by Publisher for such underconsumption as herein provided, then the parties agree to review the paper consumption performance to determine an appropriate adjustment to the paper requirements; which review may include an examination of performance by form type, makeready consumption, running rates, etc. 13. Acceptance, Warranty, Limitation of Liability. (a) Production Quality Warranty. Printer hereby warrants and represents that the finished quality of the Issues will be consistent with industry standards for general appearance and accuracy of reproduction of final WKH-approved proofs and will pass without reasonable objection in the end- market professional trade (it being acknowledged by Printer that all Titles being professional journals are measured by a higher standard of appearance and accuracy in the industry than ordinary magazine printing due to the particular demands of professional end users). Further, Printer hereby represents and warrants that in manufacturing each Issue it shall comply with the relevant sections of the Specifications for Web Offset Publications, Tenth edition, and subsequent errata. Should any Product not meet any of the above industry standards it shall not be deemed to be eligible for 7 ao “Acceptance”. In addition to other remedies allowed hereunder for failure to achieve Acceptance, upon any breach of any warranty and/or representation set forth in this Agreement, WKH may elect one of the following additional remedies: (i) receive a pro rata reimbursement of the price paid for Product failing to meet the Acceptance standard (or the portion thereof if the same can be apportioned with respect to which failures in standards are claimed) followed by the prompt recovery of such defective Issues by the Printer at Printer’s sole cost and expense, or (ii) receive a replacement of any defectively printed Issue at no cost and expense. (b) Advertisement/ Insert Pick-up, Placement and Match Warranty. Printer hereby warrants it will pick-up, place and match advertisements & inserts as defined by WKH. Upon breach of this warranty, WKH will receive reimbursement from Printer for any manufacturing cost of said advertisements & inserts WKH can demonstrate by reasonable evidence to have been lost as a direct result of Printer’s breach of this warranty. Except as provided to the contrary explicitly in this Agreement, Printer shall not be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages, including but not limited to the customer’s loss of sales arising from breach of warranty. Claims for shortages, defective or damaged goods shall be made by WKH in writing within 30 days after receipt of the affected Product and are otherwise deemed waived, provided such thirty (30) day period shall not begin to run on Products delivered into storage by Printer until such time as WKH receives delivery of the first large sample of any such Order. 14. Service Level Agreement. Printer will commit to the following service levels on a calendar quarterly basis beginning with the quarter ending June, 2007: e Order Acknowledgement Interval: 100% by next business day. Calculated as acknowledgments sent by Printer the next business day after final print files are received divided by the total number of Orders submitted in the measurement period. e Manufacturing Schedule Compliance: 100% of Issues fulfilled in Committed Turnaround Times that are less than or equal to the commitments in Paragraph 7(b). Calculated as the number of Issues manufactured within the committed Turnaround Times divided by the total number of Issues ordered in the measurement period. e First Time Manufacturing Quality: 0% Unacceptable Issues. An Issue is deemed Unacceptable if any one or more Products within the Order are not deemed to meet the Acceptance standards set forth in this Agreement. Calculated as the number of Issues delivered to end users or warehouses by bulk shipment that do not meet such Acceptance standard (but not including those Products sent solely to storage at WKH’s direction for the entire measurement period) divided by the total number of Issues ordered in the measurement period. Issues deemed Unaccepted and re-printed by Printer are not included in this calculation. e First Time Billing Accuracy: At least 99%. This will be calculated as percent of invoices accurately generated (per Paragraph 10, Payment Terms) the first time divided by the total number of invoices generated in the measurement period. In order for an invoice to be considered properly generated, it must not be disputed by WKH within 30 days or if disputed within 30 days, it must thereafter be shown to be accurate with such proof reasonably accepted by WKH. Invoices that remain in good faith dispute beyond 90 days will be considered inaccurately generated for the purposes of calculating this SLA metric. Printer will provide a monthly report indicating Printer’s performance against the service levels defined above. Each quarterly report of service levels shall be delivered to WKH’s Vice President of Strategic Sourcing no later than ten (10) days after the close of each calendar quarter. ‘Failure to meet two or more SLA commitments in any one quarter or the same SLA commitment in any two successive quarters will be considered a material and incurable breach of this Agreement for purposes of Paragraph 2 hereof. 15. Customer Service and Account Management. Printer will provide daily updates on the status of WKH’s Orders. Printer will provide each of WKH’s units an individual daily status report. Daily status reports shall include, at a minimum, the schedule status for the following milestones: file-in date, proof-out date (if proof requested), proof-in date (if proof requested), on-press date, mail date and shipping date (if applicable). Printer will organize a quarterly review meeting with a WKH team consisting of at least one representative from each unit served by Printer. The purpose of this meeting will be to review paper consumption, SLA metrics, root cause of any failures, corrective action plans to address such failures, and opportunities for improvement. If as a result of such a meeting the parties agree that there is an area of mutual interest that warrants further investigation or development, the parties shall set up a schedule and milestones to monitor the progress of such investigation or development. The parties will review or modify such schedules and milestones on a mutually agreed upon timetable. 16. Account Team. Printer will provide an account team with a sufficient number of resources and experience to support WKH’s needs. Printer shall identify initial core account team members to WKH. Printer acknowledges it will use all reasonable means to maintain the initial core account team in place. If Printer decides to replace a core account team member, for example, to support other accounts, it will seek to provide a seamless transition which will include a four week overlap of the existing account team member and his or her replacement. Should any of the account team members leave the employ of Printer, WKH shall have reasonable rights of approval over any member added to the team as a replacement. Further, should WKH become dissatisfied with the performance of any member, Printer shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly replace that member with another Printer employee reasonably acceptable to WKH. 17. Insurance. Printer shall obtain, pay for and keep in force while providing services hereunder, and thereafter as provided below, the following insurance: (a) Statutory workers compensation covering all state and local requirements; (b) Employers liability with a limit of $1,000,000 for one or more claims arising from each accident; (c) Commercial general liability, including coverage for completed operations, products liability and contractual obligations in an amount not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate for bodily injury and property damage arising out of premises and operations and products and completed operations; (d) Comprehensive automobile covering all vehicles in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims arising out of bodily injury and property damage; and (e) Printers liability for errors and omissions with a limit of $1,000,000 providing coverage for a period of at least two years following completion of the services.'"

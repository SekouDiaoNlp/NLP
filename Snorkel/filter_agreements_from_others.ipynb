portal  for test pur    poses   the first step of the migration of c3 will be done for two pilot product families that need to be   chosen in the first month. after this migration the dates for the remaining 8 product families   will be fixed in agreement with wolters kluwer.   1.6 migration strategy  frozen zones and fall back scenarios   t systems focus for the transition is to create as little impact as possible to the wolters klu    wer business. however  there will a time of approximately four hours in which the platform in   migration will have a read only status. this frozen zone will be scheduled in the night or on   weekends to minimize the impact on the business.   the basic idea of the migration is to change the  time to live   ttl  of the dns information.   the normal duration normally takes three days. in the transition phase it will be changed to   one hour. this means that the information about the new url will be know over the internet   in approximately one hour. requests to the old url will get to the old servers. the current   environment and the new environment are both in a read only mode and show the same   content. for the users there will be no difference.   the suggested migration procedure will be the following    preparation  evaluation of content based redirection from old to new platform   identify dns administrator within wolters kluwers organization.   test ttl modification  e.g. from 3 to 2 days  by wolters kluwers administrator   go live  reduce ttl to one hour by wolters kluwers administrator   put the old platform in read only mode   update the content on the new platform   put new platform in read only mode   get scenario test   do final test new platform   shift dns to the new platform   replace content on old platform within service page   monitor new platform s logs and load.   decide to continue production on new platform    put new platform in read write mode    verify decreasing requests on old platform   reset ttl to 3 days   in this procedure different events will require to do a fallback operation. in all cases the cur    rent environment is still in place and has the same content running. in the case of a fall back   the dns shift needs to go back to the old url. as the time to live  ttl  information is still   on one hour the fallback is realized latest in one hour.

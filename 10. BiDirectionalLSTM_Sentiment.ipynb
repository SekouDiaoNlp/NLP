They stated because I have delinquent credit obligations with other creditors. This info was obtained by BB & T thru XXXX. I pulled my credit using the Annual Credit report website and chose XXXX. My credit history with all but one creditor was in good standing. The creditor in question was a card my wife and I had in both our names. She put some dental work on the card and forgot to pay it and didn't even realize she was behind until my line of credit was frozen. I called BB & T XXXX PA Branch and spoke with XXXX XXXX NMLS ID XXXX. She was also the person I spoke with when I applied and obtained the loan in the first place back in XXXX/XXXX  2019. She looked into it and she called me back, said that the line of credit would be frozen for a year. I was in shock. I have plans for this money in the next 12 months and now everything must be placed on hold. She suggested a formal request to unfreeze the a/c to escalate the problem in the BB & T company. I received a notice stating that again my line was frozen because of the same delinquent account and would remain frozen. Also, this loan was opened with a variable rate. I asked if the could be fixed so I can build a payment plan to pay the line of credit off as soon as I can. She looked into it and got back to me, she stated that no, the loan can not be changed from a variable to a fixed for the same reason as the suspension, delinquent account. The delinquent account that caused this mess is now caught up with the payments and in good standing. My credit report reflects this. Its outrageous. I work hard on my credit to be in good standing. All of my other accounts are impeccable. One credit card with a {$600.00} balance that was grossly overlooked and my HELOC and all the plans I have for it is in jeopardy. How I want this to be resolved is 1. I want the suspension to be lifted from my HELOC and be able to use the funds immediately and 2. be able to lock the HELOC into a fixed rate loan.\",\n",
